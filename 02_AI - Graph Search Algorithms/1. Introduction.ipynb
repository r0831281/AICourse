    "AI problems are often modelled as a state space, a set of states that a problem can be in. The set of states forms a graph where two states are connected if there is an operation that can be performed to transform the first state into the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of an AI problem is then a **sequence of actions, called the plan** that transforms the start state (the state from where the search begins) to the goal state. This plan is achieved through search algorithms. There are far too many powerful search algorithms out there to fit in this lesson. Instead, we will discuss four of the fundamental search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson we will use one of those search algoritms to find our way through a maze."
